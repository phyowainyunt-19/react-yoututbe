## Reflection

This project was built during 2022. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, Redux, Data, and a significant amount of JSX and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
